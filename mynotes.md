## Mods to this app

I am going to attempt the following modifications to this app:

1. Use a color code for bounding boxes (live, dead, vcut).
1. Add confidence value to bounding box label.
1. Select any combination of classes to be displayed (live, dead, vcut).
1. Allow selecting min confidence.
1. Allow selecting portrate/landscape orientation.
1. Add a splash screen and/or config screen.

## Mods to future app

1. Select an image on the phone and apply the object detector to it. Save results in a file.
1. Save results in an SQLite database. Include lat/lon if available.
1. Process all files in a selected directory.
